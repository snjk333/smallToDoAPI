API should:
    Create Task using controller
    Return Tasks by title
    Return Tasks by date
    Return Tasks by ActualDate

To (Create Task using controller) we need:
    receive some DTO object
    map it to entity class
    save to db

To (Return Tasks by title) we need:
    receive String title
    find by title
    return DTO object

To (Return Tasks by date) we need:
    receive date date
    map it to our LocalDate format
    find by date
    return LIST of DTO objects

To (Return Tasks by ActualDate) we need:
    receive a get mapping that FIND MY TODAY's TASKS
    find by now() date
    return LIST of DTO objects

    is response and request dto is it the same?..
    good question
